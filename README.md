# My Flutter-Flask App

## Overview

This app is a mobile application developed using Flutter and a backend server built with Flask. It is designed as an assignment project to demonstrate the integration of a cross-platform mobile framework with a lightweight Python web framework.

## Features

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on both Android and iOS devices.
- **User Authentication**: Includes signup and login functionalities.
- **Data Handling**: Fetches, displays, and manipulates data from the Flask backend.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with smooth navigation.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with the Flask server using RESTful APIs.

## Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Flask**: Install Flask using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install Flask
  ```
- **Dependencies**: Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` for the Flask backend and `pubspec.yaml` for the Flutter app.

## Installation

### Flutter App

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-flask-app.git
   cd flutter-flask-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

### Flask Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in a `.env` file or export them in your shell:

- **FLASK_ENV**: Set to `development` for development mode.
- **DATABASE_URL**: URL for the database if using one.

### API Endpoints

Define your API endpoints in the `app.py` file or corresponding route files within the Flask backend.

### Flutter Configuration

Update the base URL for the API in your Flutter app, typically found in a configuration file or at the top of the service classes that handle HTTP requests.
